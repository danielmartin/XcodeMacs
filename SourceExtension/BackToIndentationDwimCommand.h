/**
 * Implementation of a modified version of back-to-indentation:
 *   - When the point is at the first non-whitespace character of the line, go to the beginning of the line.
 *   - Otherwise, go to the first non-whitespace character of the line.
 *
 * Here's my original Elisp implementation:
 *
 * (defun back-to-indentation-dwim ()
 *   "Toggle between moving the point to the start of the first non-whitespace character and the start of the line."
 *   (interactive)
 *   (let ((start-position (point)))
 *     ;; Move to the first non-whitespace character.
 *     (back-to-indentation)
 *     ;; If we haven't moved, go to the start of the line.
 *     (when (= (point) start-position)
 *       (move-beginning-of-line nil))))
